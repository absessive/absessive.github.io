First blog post. Decisions. Decisions. What should I write about? 

I'll start off with Jekyll. I've been holding off on creating a blog for so long and then I found out about [Jekyll][jekyll], a static site generator. Its what [Github pages][github.io] run on. It's' a breeze to set up. 

Once the jekyll gem in installed as per the [quickstart][jekyll-quickstart], write away with a mix of Markdown and HTML to create your own blog. 

# Github pages
I've used Wordpress before and agree its neat. I spend a lot of my time in github and thats where Jekyll + Github Pages makes it easy. With Jekyll, creating a new post is as easy as creating a new ```.markdown``` file in ```_posts```. Prefix the markdown file with the date in the ````YYYY-MM-DD````format. For eg. this post is labelled ```2015-02-11-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown``` and you can find it [here][page-link]. 

As I discover more of Jekyll's features, I hope the blog will look better and be organized decently. Maybe, I should learn to style my pages better.
