First blog post. Decisions. Decisions. What should I write about? I'll start off with Jekyll. I've been holding off on creating a blog for so long and then I found out about [jekyll], a static site generator. Its what [github.io] pages run on, and once I got it up and running. It seems like a breeze to set up. As I discover more of Jekyll's features, I hope the blog will look better and be organized decently.
